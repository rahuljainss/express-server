# <p align="center">MERN STACK</p>

### INTRODUCTION

* MERN stack is the name given to a set of JavaScript based technologies used in developing web applications.MERN is the acronym name given to the set of technologies including Mongo DB, Express JS, React JS/ Redux and Node JS. Among these technologies Mongo DB is a database system, Node JS is a back-end runtime environment, Express JS is a back-end web framework and React is a front-end framework.

* JavaScript has evolved into two web stacks, MEAN and MERN. These frameworks are becoming increasingly popular among the industry and our customers and stand for:
MEAN – MongoDB, Express, Angular, Node.js
MERN – MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js

### IMPORTANCE

* A standard stack accelerates time to market and fosters familiarity and standards for developers. Adopting the stack also addresses critical but repetitive development tasks that redirects efforts towards building and innovating upon a breakthrough application. Particularly as organizations adopt more DevOps frameworks, a standardized stack also means more time for deployment and market testing.

* These stacks are also important because of the breaking down of application silos through REST APIs. As applications become less of an isolated entity, it can now interact through public APIs to grant developers the power to allow customers to perform actions including connecting through Facebook, registering with Twitter, or pinning a location on a map.

### MONGO DB

* Mongo DB is a free and open-source cross-platform document-oriented database program. Classified as a No SQL database program, Mongo DB uses JSON-like documents with schemata. Mongo DB is developed by Mongo DB Inc., and is published under a combination of the GNU Affero General Public License and the Apache License.

### EXPRESS

* Express.js, or simply Express, is a web application framework for Node.js, released as free and open-source software under the MIT License. It is designed for building web applications and APIs. It has been called the de facto standard server framework for Node.js.

* The original author, TJ Holowaychuk, described it as a Sinatra-inspired server, meaning that it is relatively minimal with many features available as plugins. Express is the backend part of the MEAN stack, together with Mongo DB database and AngularJS frontend framework.

### REACT

* React (also known as React.js or React JS) is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It is maintained by Facebook and a community of individual developers and companies.

* React can be used as a base in the development of single-page or mobile applications. Complex React applications usually require the use of additional libraries for state management, routing, and interaction with an API.

* Redux is an open-source JavaScript library for managing application state. It is most commonly used with libraries such as React or Angular for building user interfaces. Similar to (and inspired by) Facebook's Flux architecture, it was created by Dan Abramov and Andrew Clark.

### NODE JS

* Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript run-time environment that executes JavaScript code outside of a browser. 

* Historically, JavaScript was used primarily for client-side scripting, in which scripts written in JavaScript are embedded in a webpage's HTML and run client-side by a JavaScript engine in the user's web browser. 

* Node.js lets developers use JavaScript to write Command Line tools and for server-side scripting—running scripts server-side to produce dynamic web page content before the page is sent to the user's web browser.

* Consequently, Node.js represents a "JavaScript everywhere" paradigm, unifying web application development around a single programming language, rather than different languages for server side and client side scripts.

### ADVANTAGES OF MERN STACK

* The main advantage for developers using the MERN stack is that every line of code is written in JavaScript. This is a programming language that’s used everywhere, both for client-side code and server-side code. With one language across tiers, there’s no need for context switching.

* For tech stack with multiple programming languages, developers have to figure out how to interface them together. With the JavaScript stack, developers only need to be proficient in JavaScript and JSON.

* Overall, using the MERN stack enables developers to build highly efficient web applications
